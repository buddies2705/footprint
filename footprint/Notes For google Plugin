Notes For google Plugin 


1 . icon.png should be in same package and size is 19 sq px


2.popup.html will be rendered inside the popup window that's created in response to a user's click on the browser action. It's a standard HTML file, just like you're used to from web development, giving you more or less free reign over what the popup displays.


3.The actual logic of rendering the content of the popup is implemented by popup.js. You are encouraged to read the elaborate comments in this file to learn more about the logic.
Download a copy of popup.js from our sample repository , and save it into the directory you're working in.

You should now have four files in your working directory: icon.png, manifest.json, popup.html, popup.js. The next step is to load those files into Chrome.


i Need to use browser action because my plugin is related to most of the pages .and need not to disable as well as clickable and intractive .(https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction)
